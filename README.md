# Hi there 👋 

<!-- English version -->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on becoming an awesome programmer who can write code so elegant it feels like art.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to debug late at night without instant noodles and how to make code inherently romantic.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building a zero-gravity universe powered by lines of code.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with figuring out how to make writing code look irresistibly attractive to girls.  
- 💬 Ask me about the bittersweet moments of coding—when a bug crushes you but fixing it makes you feel invincible.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email…  
- 😄 whoami : haha. A time-traveling Bug Hunter.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to write a program to generate a love confession but realized love’s compiler doesn’t support every language.
- 🌟okey let's talk about my wishes!🌟
  - I wish the most talented woman in the world, Taylor Swift, could be with another most talented woman in the world. Together, they would create the most perfect love album ever—a masterpiece full of timeless songs that touch hearts and heal souls ❤️.
